DINAMICA project. TODO list.

* Matlab set of function for T-system. This will increase number of potential users.

* T-system assistant: identifies major known problems and try to solve it without user-intervention.

* T-system support of systems with different time scales: these produce the "true" slopes as
  well as not "true" ones due to "fluctuations".

* More universal, system-independent random number generator.

*? Mean trajectory for stochastic simulations.

*? Make transient period for the time series -- the initial time interval that is
  skipped when processed.

* Variability of the parameters: draw the parameter values from the distributions
  modeling the external noise source.

*? Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) capability.

* There is a need in script language that would interprete a series of commands plus
  special structures like for and if statements. This is especially useful for
  parameter space exploration. There is a basic parameter continuation tool, but it
  is really primitive.

* Delayed ODEs/SSA

* Fast Fourier Transform of stochastic oscillations.

* Clusterization. This program was not originally set for cluster
analysis. The same way so far. This should be fixed.

* Parameter continuation. Step size adaptive algorithm should
developed or any existing library alogorithm should be used.

* Make `one run' mode in the program. Dinamica is executed for once
and fulfils one single task.

* Add special functions recognition algorithm in the parser like cos,
sin, tg, exp etc.

* Make command line interpreter guess input from the user. By pressing
Tab twice(like in shell) or while typing.
